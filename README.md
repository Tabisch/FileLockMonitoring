# FileLockMonitoring

Powershell scripts to get processes locking file

It relies on openfiles\
You have to enable that first\
You can use the enable script for that and have to restart the computer after that.

Nearlly all scripts have parameters.\
Just look at the files or tab through them, because i havent documented anything.\
Maybe i will take some time to polish this and make it in to a proper module.

For your info everything kinda slow and is somewhat heavy on the cpu, but there is nothing i can do about that, as far as i know.\
Guess thats the reason why its disabled by default
